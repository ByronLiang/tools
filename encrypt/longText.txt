Take things as they come. It's really easy to get caught up in planning for or daydreaming about the future.
For me, sometimes that translates into panicking or having anxiety about a future that hasn't happened yet — a complete hypothetical.
I have to remind myself that so much of the world is not in my control; in fact all of it is out of my control except for myself.
All any of us can do is control our own actions in the moment and our own perspective on things. I’m learning focus on what is happening now and teaching myself to bring my mind back to the present.
And I'm trying to have faith that, when any situation arises, I'll have the confidence and the ability to cross that bridge when I come to it.
Let other people know that you are there for them. I have a few close people in my life that I know I could call, day or night, rain or shine. And for a handful of people, I am pretty sure that I am that person for them.
The only reason I know that is because they have told me — and shown me with their actions — that I can always depend on them. Tell the people you care about that you are there because you never know when you both might need each other.
